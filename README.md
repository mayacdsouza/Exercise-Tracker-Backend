This repository compromises the backend code for an exercise tracker I designed in CS290: Web Development. For the frontend code and more information on this project, see this link: https://github.com/mayacdsouza/Exercise-Tracker-Frontend

To run this application....

    1. Clone the front and backend repositories.
    
    2. Run node install in both repositories to install the necessary node modules.
    
    3. Create a .env file in the background repository with the following:
        MONGODB_CONNECT_STRING = <connect string to your account>
        PORT = <port number>
        
    4. Run node start in both repositories to start both servers.
